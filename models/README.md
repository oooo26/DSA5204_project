# Models

- Pix2pix: [`pix2pix/`](pix2pix)
- Coupled GAN: [`CoGAN/`](CoGAN)
- Dual GAN: [`DualGAN/`](DualGAN)
- Cycle GAN: [`CycleGAN/`](CycleGAN)
- Spatial Correlative Loss: [`F-LSeSim/`](F-LSeSim)

## Run on our dataset

The dataloader should be modified to use other dataset, like [selfie2anime](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/selfie2anime).

- For Pix2pix, you may need to manually pair the images;
- For CoGAN, you may need to modify the network to fit higher resolution;
