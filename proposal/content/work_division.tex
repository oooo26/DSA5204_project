\section{Division of work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yanrong Chen: The analysis of ablation study.
    \item Shuyuan Shen: The reproduction of the original model, evaluate the performance of the model whose loss function is based on adversarial loss+cycle-consistency loss on the selfie2anime dataset.
    \item Yuhua Wang: The comparison of the extended model and the original model on the Zebra dataset.
    \item Geer Zhang: The extension model of the loss function covering the self similarity feature, evaluate the performance on the selfie2anime dataset.
    \item Junhao Huang: The performance of other models i.e., CoGAN, Pixel loss+ GAN in the baseline on the selfie2anime dataset.
\end{itemize}
