\section{Citation}

In this project, we would reference these publications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Unpaired Image-To-Image Translation Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks}\cite{zhu_unpaired_2017}.
    \item \textit{Deep Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation: A Review}\cite{sym12101705}.
    \item \textit{Analyzing and improving the image quality of stylegan}\cite{karras2020analyzing}.
    \item \textit{GANs trained by a two time-scale update rule converge to a local nash equilibrium}\cite{heusel2017gans}.
    \item \textit{Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks}\cite{isola2017image}.
    \item \textit{Improved techniques for training GANs}\cite{salimans2016improved}.
    \item \textit{Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition}\cite{simonyan2014very}.
\end{itemize}

More specifically, we plan to reproduce and
do some further researches mainly on the first one,
and the type of project is \textbf{application}.
